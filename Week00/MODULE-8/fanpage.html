    <p>The University of Utah is the best University in all of the land.  The reasons for this are</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Great Academics</li>
    <li>Beautiful Campus</li>
    <li>New Buildings</li>
    <li>Tech Oriented</li>
    <li><strong>GREAT FOOTBALL TEAM</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I first became a Utah Football fan when I was 9 years old.  My Best friend was a huge fan of the "Y", however the two of us were naturally competative, so of course I wanted to choose the opposite of him, thus my obsession came at a very young age.</p>
    <p>Over time, my passion for the U's football team has grown stronger and stronger.  I knew I had a problem when I checked my pulse after one of the close games and it read at a whopping 140 beats per minute.  Yep you read that right... just from a football game. It's become a problem, certaily an <em>addiction</em>.</p>

    <p>My wife and I try to travel to at least one away game every year.  My bucket-list goal, before I die, is to watch the Utes play an away football game in every Pac-12 football arena.  So far we have seen them in 2.  one-sixth of the way there isn't too bad for my late twenties...I guess.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do before football season is to get myself pumped up by watching some highlights of the previous season.  Highlights like this one!</p>

    <p>There is <strong>nothing</strong> quite like the BYU vs UTAH rivalry and it always makes it <em>that much better</em> when my team comes out on the winning side.</p>
