Project plan:

variables: puff / bomb / score
    -need to be able to create a random location after being touched
    -kill the script when the bomb is touched
    -score will change each time the puff is touched by the main character
    -bomb score will change each time the bomb is touched by the main character

if/else statements
  -the entire thing will be in one giant if/else statement due to the score
  if the bomb score < 1 -- run the rest of the scrip
    else "You Lose"
